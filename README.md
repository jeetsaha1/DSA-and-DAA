# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms AND Design and Analysis of an Algorithms (DSA & DAA)

Welcome to this repository.  
This repository contains well-structured assignments and programs in **C** and **Python** for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**, prepared as part of **2nd Year coursework**.

The aim of this repository is to strengthen **problem-solving skills**, **algorithmic thinking**, and **implementation techniques** using both **procedural** and **high-level** programming languages.
