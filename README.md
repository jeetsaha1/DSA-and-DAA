🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA & DAA)

Welcome to this repository!
This repository contains well-structured assignments and programs in C and Python for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Design & Analysis of Algorithms (DAA), prepared as part of 2nd Year coursework.

The aim is to strengthen problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and implementation techniques using both procedural and high-level languages.
